This is a blog post version of a talk that I gave at OpenTofu day EU 2025.
If you prefer to watch the talk, you can find the recording [here]().

# Introduction

For roughly three years now, I've had the privilege of working at the largest commercial streaming service in Sweden, TV4 Play.
My role has been within the cloud infrastructure team, doing platform engineering work to enable our developers to deploy their services in a self-service manner.
Through the ownership structure of the company we are fortunate enough to share a technical platform with our sister company MTV Oy who fill a similar role in the market to us but in Finland, leading to there being a total of more than 70 developers from all disciplines using our platform.

However, the cloud infrastructure platform team only consists of 5 engineers, and we have a lot of work to do.
How can we enable our developers to deploy their services in a self-service manner without having to wait for us to do it for them and minimise the time we spend trying to teach them?

# Shifting Left

The DevOps industry as a whole has been pushing the concept of "shifting left" for a while now.
The way I interpret the idea, the point is to reveal errors in application code

# Infrastructure-as-Code

# CDK for Terraform

# Open Policy Agent
